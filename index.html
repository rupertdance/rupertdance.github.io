        <h2>Hi. I'm Rupert.</h2>
        <p>I make digital things for people. I write code. I try to work on things that matter.</p>
        <br/>

        <!-- What I can do -->
        <h2>What I can do, and <span class="underlined">what I have done</span>.</h2>

        <p>I <strong>architect</strong>. The Big Picture. What problem are we trying to solve? How does it fit into the world? Does it even need to exist?</p>

        <p>I set up the <strong>back end</strong>. Domains, a CDN for speed, make it HTTPS. Hosting, usually AWS. Databases, MariaDB on EFS. Containerisation, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm.</p>

        <p>I <strong>build and develop</strong>. The data structures. A CMS, headless or Drupal 7/8. A node.js app. Serverless, Lambda! Or just a static site, Vue / React. It must be fit for purpose. As simple, faste and secure as possible while meeting all needs. A brochure site? SquareSpace. Selling a lot? Shopify, themed. Subscriptions and auto-renewing payments? Stripe. </p>

        <p>I implement <strong>web designs</strong>. The front end. HTML, LESS/SASS, JS. Give me logos in SVG, fonts, designs, and make them work. Flexbox is great, Bootstrap can be handy too. </p>

        <p>I make things <strong>usable</strong>. Nothing is sadder than good work gone unused. People need training, products need a champion. Code needs maintenance. </p>

        <p>Most importantly I keep <strong>learning</strong>. I don't know everything. There are so many tools to get things done. The examples I list above are the ones I've used and enjoyed. If you keep learning about new tools, and learning about users, you'll do well.</p>
        <br/>

        <!-- What I'm not -->
        <h2>What I know about, <span class="underlined">but what I am not</span>.</h2>
        <p>I know <strong>design</strong>. But I'm not a designer. But I've been lucky enough to work closely with some amazing people who do. I've learned a lot.</p>
    
        <p>I know <strong>security</strong>. But I'm not an cyber security specialist. But I've been lucky enough to work on very secure projects, maintain a SecureDrop server, and I know the value of 2FA and the right IAM roles.</p>

        <p>I know <strong>words</strong>. But I'm not an editor or a copy writer. But I've been lucky enough to work closely with some amazing people who are. I know how important they are.</p>
        <br/>

        <!-- Let me show you -->
        <h2>What I have done <span class="underlined">some examples</span>.</h2>
        <p>This <strong>very page</strong>, right here, is a simple example. It's only what it needs to be, clear and fast. Just HTML, CSS, some JS. It's served over HTTPS (like all sites should be). It's hosted in an S3 Bucket on AWS. This (amazing, right?) domain is managed by CloudFlare - who also provide CDN caching. </p>

        <p>A CMS, like <strong>drupal.rupert.dance</strong>. Drupal 8. It's hosted in on EC2, files on EFS, both AWS. The sub-domain is managed by CloudFlare - who again provide CDN caching. </p>
